# Patient-Q-A-System-using-RAG-LLMs

This project explores the development and comparative evaluation of two patient question-and-answer (Q&A) systems designed to improve accessibility of health information using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods.

The project investigates:

1) A retrieval-based TF-IDF system that retrieves the most relevant NHS documents in response to patient queries.

2)  A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built upon the T5-small transformer model, fine-tuned to generate concise, contextually accurate, and semantically grounded answers to
    medical questions by incorporating retrieved evidence from the TF-IDF component.

By contrasting a statistical retrieval method (TF-IDF) with a deep learningâ€“based generative approach (RAG-T5), this proeject highlights trade-offs in explainability, accuracy, and real-world feasibility for clinical communication and patient-support systems.
