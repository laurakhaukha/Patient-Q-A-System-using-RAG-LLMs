childrens hospital solihull hospital great ormond street hospital for children london guys and st thomas hospital london after the initial diagnosis its likely that you and your child will have regular follow up appointments at a specialist centre so a detailed treatment plan can be drawn up once your childs symptoms improve or stabilise it may be possible to arrange for treatment to be provided locally so youll only need to visit the specialist centre occasionally but with more severe types of eb this arrangement may not always be possible treatment teamchildren with eb often have complex needs particularly if they have a severe form of the condition theyll need to be treated by a diverse team of medical specialists working together this team can include a doctor who specialises in treating skin conditions a dermatologist a dentist a dietitian a physiotherapist a play specialist who uses playful activities to help improve a childs physical and psychological wellbeing a specialist nurse who usually acts as the contact between you and other members of the team general advice an important part of your childs treatment plan will be practical advice about how to prevent trauma or friction to your childs skin to reduce the frequency of blistering this advice will vary depending on the type of eb and the severity of your childs symptoms this advice may include not walking long distances this can cause blisters to form on the soles of your childs feet avoiding everyday knocks bumps and scratches avoiding rubbing your childs skin you may have to change the way you lift your child keeping your child as cool as possible in warm weather avoiding clothes that fit tightly or rub against the skin to try to prevent blistering wearing clothes made from natural fabrics like cotton this will also help keep your child cool choosing comfortable shoes that fit well and dont have lumpy seams inside your child may have to have a carer when theyre out in the playground and avoid playing contact sports but its important that they dont avoid physical activities or contact with other children altogether your physiotherapist should be able to recommend activities unlikely to result in blistering such as swimming skin care your treatment team will be able to advise about caring for your childs skin for example when and how to puncture new blisters how to care for wounds left by blisters and prevent infection whether to leave wounds uncovered or use dressings what types of dressing to use how to apply and remove them and how often to change them whether to use moisturising creams on your childs skin its usually recommended that new blisters are punctured lanced using a sterile needle your gp will be able to provide you with a supply of sterile needles lancing the blisters will prevent them getting bigger large blisters can leave large painful wounds that take longer to heal its usually recommended to leave the skin on top of the blister to protect the lower layers of skin if an open wound needs a dressing its best to use one that doesnt stick to the skin and is easy to remove to hold a non stick dressing in place you may be advised to use a sock cotton bandage or tubular bandage regular sticking plasters should be avoided birch bark extracta gel containing birch bark extract can help partial thickness wounds heal more quickly its recommended for people aged 6 months and over who have dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa deb or junctional epidermolysis bullosa jeb infections open wounds or raw patches of skin can often become infected and need to be treated signs that an area of skin has become infected include heat or redness around the area but redness can be harder to see on brown and black skin the area leaking pus or a watery discharge crusting on the surface of the wound a wound not healing a red streak or line spreading away from a blister or a collection of blisters a high temperature if you think your child has a skin infection let your gp know as soon as possible left untreated a skin infection can often quickly spread to other parts of the body particularly with the more severe forms of eb treatment for skin infections include antiseptic creams or ointments antibiotic creams or lotions antibiotic tablets specially designed dressings to help stimulate the healing process pain relief the blisters and wounds can be painful and make simple activities such as moving and walking difficult over the counter painkillers such as paracetamol might be enough for milder forms of eb for more severe types of eb stronger painkillers such as morphine may be needed either for background pain or for procedures like dressings changes or bathing children under the age of 16 should never be given aspirin as theres a small risk it could trigger a serious condition called reyes syndrome you may need stronger medicines such as amitriptyline or gabapentin for types of eb that cause long term pain dental care soreness caused by blisters inside your childs mouth can make cleaning their teeth difficult but good dental hygiene using a soft toothbrush and a mouthwash that contains fluoride as well as regular visits to a dentist is important nail care your childs fingernails and toenails may become thicker than normal and difficult to cut especially if blisters form under the nail your hospital team should be able to recommend creams that soften nails and make them easier to cut eye care children with severe types of eb can experience blistering and irritation in and around their eyes this usually requires treatment with eyedrops and ointments to keep the eyes moist feeding and nutrition if your baby has blisters in their mouth it can cause problems with feeding your treatment team can give you advice about how to overcome feeding problems for example feeding a baby or infant using a syringe eyedropper or artificial nipple adding liquid to mashed food to make it easier to swallow once your child is old enough to eat solids including lots of soft food in your childs diet not serving food too hot as it could cause further blistering if your child is older your treatment team can also give you advice about their diet the healing process makes great demands on the body and a healthy diet is important to help heal your childs skin wounds and avoid malnutrition your child may also need supplements in the form of milk based drinks or puddings that have high levels of protein and calories supplements of vitamins iron or zinc may also be required if theyre found to be deficient in these on blood tests your dietitian will be able to advise about this constipation is a common problem for children with eb because of blistering around the bottom which makes it painful to poo its also a side affect of some types of painkillers if your child regularly experiences constipation they may benefit from having a fibre supplement or laxative surgery surgery may be needed to treat some complications that can arise in severe cases of eb the different types of surgery are described below if your childs fingers and toes have become fused together by scar tissue creating a mitten effect surgery may be needed to separate them if your childs oesophagus the tube that connects the mouth and stomach has become narrowed by scarring surgery may be needed to widen it this is done by placing a balloon inside the oesophagus and inflating it to widen the narrowed area if your child is underweight and not growing properly because symptoms of eb make eating impossible surgery can be used to implant a feeding tube into their tummy research research is being carried out to try to find a cure or at least more effective treatments for eb initial results have been promising but

The operation usually lasts a few hours.\\nDuring the procedure:\\na large cut (incision) around 25cm long will be made along the middle of your breastbone to allow the surgeon access to your heart, although in some cases a smaller cut may be made\\ntubes are inserted into your heart and major blood vessels, which are attached to a heart-lung (bypass) machine\\xa0– this will take over the job of your heart during the operation\\nmedication is used to stop your heart and\\xa0your main artery (aorta) is clamped shut\\xa0– this allows\\xa0your surgeon\\xa0to open your heart and operate on it without blood pumping through\\nthe aorta is opened up and the damaged aortic valve is removed\\nthe\\xa0new valve is\\xa0sewn in place with a fine thread\\nyour heart is started\\xa0again using controlled electric shocks before you're taken\\xa0off the bypass machine\\nyour breastbone is joined up\\xa0with wires, and the wound on your chest closed using dissolvable stitches\\n\\nChoice of valve replacementBefore having an aortic valve replacement, you'll need to decide\\xa0on the most suitable type of replacement valve for you.\\nThere are 2 main types of replacement valve:\\nmechanical valves\\xa0made of\\xa0synthetic materials\\nbiological valves made of animal tissue\\nEach type has\\xa0advantages and disadvantages, which your doctor will discuss with you.\\nMechanical valvesThe main advantage of mechanical valves is that they're hard-wearing and less likely to need replacing.\\nThis means they're often better for younger people having a valve replacement.\\nBut there's a tendency for potentially dangerous\\xa0blood\\xa0clots to form\\xa0on the valve, so lifelong treatment with anticoagulant medicine such as\\xa0warfarin is needed to prevent this.\\nThis will increase the chances of excessive bleeding from a cut or injury, particularly as you get older, and may not be suitable if you have had significant bleeding problems in the past.\\nMechanical valves can also make a quiet clicking noise, which can be disturbing at first,\\xa0but is easy to get used to.\\nBiological valves\\xa0The main advantage of biological valves is that there's less risk of clots forming, so lifelong anticoagulant treatment isn't usually necessary.\\nBut biological valves tend to\\xa0wear out a bit faster than mechanical valves and may eventually need to be replaced after many years.\\nThis means they're often better for older people having\\xa0a valve replacement.\\n\\n Page last reviewed: 23 December 2021\\n Next review due: 23

If your GP thinks you could have an acoustic neuroma, you'll be referred to a hospital or clinic for further tests, such as hearing tests to check for hearing problems and determine whether they're caused by a problem with your nerves, an MRI scan, which uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce a detailed picture of the inside of your head, or a CT scan, which uses a series of X-rays to create a detailed image of the inside of your head.\", \"There are several different treatment options for an acoustic neuroma, depending on the size and position of your tumour, how fast it's growing and your general health. The main options are monitoring the tumour – small tumours often just need to be monitored with regular MRI scans, brain surgery – surgery to remove all or some of the tumour through a cut in the skull may be carried out under general anaesthetic if it's large or getting bigger, or stereotactic radiosurgery – small tumours, or any pieces of a larger tumour that remain after surgery, may be treated with a precise beam of radiation to stop them getting any bigger.\", 'All treatment options carry some risks. For example, surgery and radiosurgery can sometimes cause facial numbness or an inability to move part of your face (paralysis).', \"Large acoustic neuromas can be serious because they can sometimes cause a life-threatening build-up of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). But it's rare for them to reach this stage.\", \"Even with treatment, symptoms such as hearing loss and tinnitus can persist and affect your ability to work, communicate and drive. These problems may need additional treatment. It's also possible for an acoustic neuroma to occasionally return after treatment. This is thought to happen to around 1 in every 20 people who have had surgical removal. You'll probably continue having regular MRI scans after any treatment to check if the tumour is growing again or coming back.\", 'Acute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder, usually caused by a gallstone blocking the cystic duct.

Antibiotics may also be prescribed if there is evidence of infection. These treatments may be continued for up to a week.', 'If initial treatment is unsuccessful or if there is a risk of serious complications, surgery may be necessary to remove the gallbladder. There are two main types of surgery: open cholecystectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy.', 'Without prompt treatment, acute cholecystitis can lead to serious complications, including the death of gallbladder tissue or a perforated gallbladder. Emergency surgery may be required to treat these complications if they arise.', 'Adopting a healthy, balanced diet and reducing the intake of high-cholesterol foods can help lower the risk of developing gallstones, and by extension, acute cholecystitis.

It's essential that AKI is detected early and treated promptly.\", 'Symptoms of acute kidney injury include feeling sick or being sick, diarrhea, dehydration, peeing less than usual, confusion, and drowsiness. Even if it does not progress to complete kidney failure, AKI needs to be taken seriously. It has an effect on the whole body, changes how some medicines are handled by the body, and could make some existing illnesses more serious.', \"Most cases of acute kidney injury are caused by reduced blood flow to the kidneys, usually in someone who's already unwell with another health condition. This reduced blood flow could be caused by low blood volume after bleeding, excessive vomiting or diarrhea, or severe dehydration, among other factors. AKI can also be caused by problems with the kidney itself, such as inflammation of the filters, blood vessels or other structures in the kidney. This may be caused by a reaction to some medicines, infections or the liquid dye used in some types of X-rays.\", \"You’re more likely to get AKI if you’re aged 65 or over, you already have a kidney problem, such as chronic kidney disease, you have a long-term disease like heart failure, liver disease or diabetes, you’re dehydrated or unable to maintain your fluid intake independently, you have a blockage in your urinary tract (or are at risk of this), you have a severe infection or sepsis, or you're taking certain medicines, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as ibuprofen, or blood pressure medicines, such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics.\", 'A doctor may suspect AKI if you are in an \"at-risk\" group and suddenly fall ill or have symptoms of AKI. AKI is usually diagnosed with a blood test to measure your levels of creatinine, a chemical waste product produced by the muscles. If there\\'s a lot of creatinine in your blood, it means your kidneys are not working as they should. You may also be asked to give a pee sample. Urine can be tested for protein, blood cells, sugar, and waste products, which may give clues to the underlying cause.', 'The most serious complications of acute kidney injury include high levels of potassium in the blood, too much fluid in the body which can cause build-up of fluid in the arms and legs (oedema) or in the lungs (pulmonary oedema), acidic\\xa0blood (metabolic acidosis)\\xa0which can cause\\xa0nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and breathlessness, and chronic kidney disease.', \"The treatment of AKI depends on what's causing your illness and how severe it is. You may need to increase your intake of water and other fluids if you're dehydrated, antibiotics if you have an infection, or stop taking certain medicines at least until the problem is sorted. A urinary catheter, a thin tube used to drain the bladder if there's a blockage, may be inserted. Most people with AKI make a full recovery, but some go on to develop chronic kidney disease or long-term kidney failure. In severe cases, dialysis may be needed.\", 'Yes, acute kidney injury can affect children and young people.

Find out more about AKI in children from infoKID.', \"Certain medicines can increase the risk of AKI, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as ibuprofen or blood pressure medicines, such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics. Diuretics help the kidneys get rid of extra fluid from the body, but they may become less helpful when a person is dehydrated or suffering from a severe illness. Aminoglycosides, a type of antibiotic that's usually given only in hospital, are only likely to increase the risk of AKI if you're dehydrated or ill.\", \"Those at risk of AKI should be monitored with regular blood tests if they become unwell or start new medicine. It's also useful to check how much pee you're passing. Any warning signs of AKI, such as vomiting or producing little pee, require immediate investigation for AKI and treatment. People who are dehydrated or at risk of dehydration may need to be given fluids through a drip, and any medicine that seems to be making the problem worse or directly damaging the kidneys needs to be stopped, at least temporarily.\", 'Acute pancreatitis is a condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed and damaged, which can cause severe pain and other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.

Blood samples are taken before and after the injection to measure the levels of these hormones in the body.', \"Blood tests for Addison's disease include measuring the levels of sodium, potassium and cortisol in the body. Low sodium, high potassium, or low cortisol levels may indicate Addison's disease. Other blood tests include measuring aldosterone, ACTH, glucose, and adrenal antibodies.\", \"Scans, such as CT scans or MRI scans, are used to visualize the adrenal glands and check for any abnormalities or damage. This can help in the diagnosis of Addison's disease, as the condition can cause damage to the adrenal glands.\", \"A thyroid function test is used to determine if the thyroid gland is working properly. The test measures the levels of certain hormones in the blood to detect any abnormalities. People with Addison's disease often have an underactive thyroid gland, which can be detected through this test.\", \"An adrenal crisis is a serious condition that can occur in people with Addison's disease when the body suddenly becomes unable to produce enough cortisol and aldosterone. Symptoms can include dehydration, low blood pressure, fever, confusion, and even coma. It is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment.\", \"If a person with a bus, coach, or lorry license is diagnosed with Addison's disease, they are legally obligated to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) of their condition.

In most cases, they don't cause any symptoms and don't need to be treated.\", 'Gallstones often have no symptoms. However, if a gallstone becomes trapped in an opening inside the gallbladder, it can cause sudden, intense pain in the tummy that usually lasts between 1 and 5 hours. This type of abdominal pain is known as biliary colic. Some people with gallstones may also develop complications such as inflammation of the gallbladder.', 'The gallbladder is a small pouch-like organ found underneath the liver. Its main purpose is to store and concentrate bile, a liquid produced by the liver to help digest fats.', 'Gallstones are thought to develop because of an imbalance in the chemical makeup of bile inside the gallbladder. In most cases, the levels of cholesterol in bile become too high, and the excess cholesterol forms into stones.', 'The risk of developing gallstones is higher if you are overweight or obese, female (particularly if you have had children), or 40 or over (the risk increases as you get older). However, anyone can develop gallstones.', \"In most cases, it's not necessary to treat gallstones as they do not cause any symptoms and do not need to be treated. However, if they are causing symptoms or complications such as jaundice or acute pancreatitis, treatment may be necessary.\", 'Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a simple surgical procedure to remove the gallbladder. It is recommended if gallstones are causing symptoms or complications. It involves making small incisions in the abdomen and using a tiny camera to guide the surgeon to remove the gallbladder. It has a low risk of complications.', \"After the gallbladder is removed, your liver will still produce bile to digest food, but the bile will drip continuously into the small intestine rather than building up in the gallbladder. It's possible to lead a normal life without a gallbladder.\", 'Very severe cases of gallstone disease can be life-threatening, particularly in people who are already in poor health. But deaths from gallstone disease are rare in the UK. With treatment, the outlook for people with gallstones is usually good.', 'Gastritis is a condition where your stomach lining becomes inflamed, causing pain, indigestion, feeling sick, and other symptoms.

If necessary, they may also perform an upper endoscopy, where a thin tube with a camera is passed into your stomach to look for any inflammation or other issues.', 'The treatment for gastritis depends on the underlying cause. Treatment options may include antibiotics for bacterial infections, medications to control stomach acid, such as antacids, proton pump inhibitors, or alginates, or simply stopping the use of anti-inflammatory painkillers or excessive alcohol consumption. In severe cases, hospitalization may be required.', 'To prevent gastritis, you can try to avoid triggers such as excessive alcohol consumption, taking anti-inflammatory painkillers, and stress. Other preventive measures include ensuring you get adequate sleep, managing your stress levels, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding acidic, spicy, or fatty foods that could irritate your stomach lining.', 'You should see a GP if you experience tummy pain or indigestion for longer than a week, or if your symptoms are getting worse or coming back frequently. You should also see your GP if you experience other symptoms such as persistent nausea or vomiting, loss of appetite, or difficulty swallowing.', 'During a breath test for H. pylori, you will be given a special drink containing a harmless chemical. Your breath will then be checked for the presence of H. pylori bacteria, which can indicate whether or not you have an infection in your stomach causing gastritis.', \"If you're experiencing mild symptoms of gastritis, there are some things you can do at home to help, such as reducing your intake of caffeine-containing drinks, avoiding acidic or spicy foods, sleeping on an extra pillow to keep your head elevated, and losing weight if you're overweight.
